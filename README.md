### Personal Projects - Solo Development
| Project | Webpage | Description |
| - | - | - |
| [Tiny Renderer](https://github.com/tatemaguire/tinyrenderer) | | Tiny Renderer is a 3D rendering API that I implemented in C++. I used Bresenham’s line algorithm and Barycentric coordinates to draw lines and triangles on screen with UV texture mapping and flat shading. I also designed and implemented a Matrix class to use for calculating perspective projection. |
| Ghost | [Play!](https://tatemaguire.itch.io/ghost) | Ghost is a puzzle game I made for the week-long Uni Game Jam 2025. I made it using Pico-8, a fantasy retro console with strict limitations. I made a custom particle system that reacts to player movement in unique ways. |
| [Pink Yellow Swaparoni](https://github.com/tatemaguire/PinkYellowPlatformer) | [Play!](https://tatemaguire.itch.io/pys) | Pink Yellow Swaparoni is a 2D metroidvania platformer I made that started as a school project but quickly turned into a bite-sized passion project. I designed it, programmed movement mechanics and particles, and synthesized sound effects. To make level editing easier, I created a special 'Tiled' tilemap parser to separate the parallel pink and yellow worlds. |

### GDA Projects - Large Team Projects
| Project | Webpage | Description |

| Crowd Surfers | | I am currently a Sound Producer for our 2026 Mock Studio game, Crowd Surfers. I'll be leading production of sound assets, especially SFX, and organizing tasks for GDA's sound department. |
| Well Witches | [Play!](https://game-design-art-collab.itch.io/well-witches) | For our 2025 Mock Studio game, I programmed player abilities, interaction, and some UI elements, including the announcement UI. I also worked closely with the rest of the programming department to brainstorm solutions to software design issues we ran in to. |
| Malisense | [Play!](https://game-design-art-collab.itch.io/malisense) | For our 2024 Mock Studio game, I implemented custom camera movement and some UI elements. |
